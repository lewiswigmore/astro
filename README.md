## About The Project

This project is a static web application built with **Astro** and **React** that teaches users how to write KQL queries through a series of narrative-driven "Space Missions".

Users take on the role of a data detective in a sci-fi setting, using real KQL queries to solve puzzles, analyze logs, and uncover mysteries.

## Features

* **Interactive Holodeck**: A Monaco-based code editor with KQL syntax highlighting.
* **Real-world Queries**: "Uplink" feature to run queries directly in Azure Data Explorer.
* **Gamification**: Earn "Stardust", level up, and track your daily streak.
* **Narrative Missions**: Learn concepts like filtering, aggregation, and joins through story.
