Before we engage the main thrusters, we must verify that your console is receiving telemetry from the `SecurityLogs` database.

### 1. Comms Check

Execute a simple ping to the system. This confirms your query editor is transmitting.

> **Pro Tip:** Hover over any code block and click **UPLINK** to instantly run the query in the real Azure Data Explorer environment.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Simple test query to verify cluster access
print "Systems Online"`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 2. Scan for Data Streams

Now, let's scan the sector for available data streams (tables). This command will list all available logs in the database.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// List all tables available in the SecurityLogs database
.show tables`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 3. Test Telemetry Feed

Finally, let's pull a small sample of data from the `AuthenticationEvents` stream to ensure the feed is stable.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Test query to retrieve a small sample from AuthenticationEvents
AuthenticationEvents
| take 5`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

> **Mission Status:** If all three checks return green (valid results), your pre-flight check is complete. You are cleared for takeoff.

> **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter static (errors), verify your uplink to `help.kusto.windows.net` and ensure you are locked onto the `SecurityLogs` database.
