import Holodeck from '../../../components/Holodeck';

In the Kusto Nebula, data flows like a river. You start with a source (a table) and channel it through a series of **operators** using the pipe `|` character. Each operator modifies the stream before passing it to the next.

### 1. The Pipe (`|`)

Think of the pipe as a docking port. It connects one module to the next.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Example of piping data through multiple operators
AuthenticationEvents
| project timestamp, hostname, src_ip, user_agent, result
`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 2. Scanning the Blueprint (`getschema`)

Before you can navigate a data stream, you need to know what it contains. The `getschema` operator reveals the structure of the table—its columns and data types.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Using the getschema operator
AuthenticationEvents
| getschema`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 3. Short-Range Scans (`take`)

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL:** Never attempt to download an entire galaxy map at once. It will overload your ship's computer.

Always use the `take` operator to grab a small sample of records when you first encounter a new table.

<Holodeck initialCode={`AuthenticationEvents
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />
