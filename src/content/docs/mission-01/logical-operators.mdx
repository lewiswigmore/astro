To filter data effectively, you need to speak the language of logic. These operators allow you to compare values and combine multiple conditions.

### 1. Equality and Inequality

*   `==`: Equals (Case-sensitive)
*   `!=`: Does not equal
*   `=~`: Equals (Case-insensitive) - **PILOT FAVORITE**
*   `!~`: Does not equal (Case-insensitive)

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Find all failed logins (case-insensitive)
AuthenticationEvents
| where result =~ "failed login"
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 2. Numerical Comparisons

When dealing with counts, sizes, or levels, use standard mathematical comparisons:

*   `>` : Greater than
*   `<` : Less than
*   `>=`: Greater than or equal to
*   `<=`: Less than or equal to

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Find files larger than 5000 bytes
FileCreationEvents
| where size > 5000
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 3. Combining Conditions (`and` & `or`)

You can chain multiple filters together to narrow your search.

*   `and`: Both conditions must be true.
*   `or`: At least one condition must be true.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Find failed logins for a specific user
AuthenticationEvents
| where result =~ "failed login" and username == "jadenman"
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 4. Set Logic (`in` & `!in`)

The `in` operator checks if a value exists within a list of possibilities.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Find specific crew members by name
Employees
| where name in ("Aaron Bueckers", "Aaron Collinsworth", "Abe Jarrette")
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />
