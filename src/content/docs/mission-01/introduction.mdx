import Holodeck from '../../../components/Holodeck';

Welcome to the cockpit, Cadet. You are about to embark on a journey through the **Kusto Nebula**. Your vessel is powered by **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**, the most efficient propulsion system for navigating massive streams of telemetry data.

In this first session, our objective is to get you flight-ready. By the end of this mission, you will be able to:

*   **Navigate** the data galaxy (Tables & Columns)
*   **Filter** out cosmic noise (Where & Project)
*   **Analyze** signal patterns (Summarize & Render)

## The Holodeck

Before we proceed, test your console in the simulation environment below. This is a **Tactical Holodeck Simulation** - it allows you to practice KQL syntax safely before connecting to a live cluster.

*   **Run Simulation:** Executes the query in our simulator and awards **Stardust** for successful completion.
*   **Real-World Uplink:** Opens your current query in the actual **Azure Data Explorer (ADX)** environment for live execution against the `help` cluster.

## Target Coordinates

We will be conducting our maneuvers in the **SecurityLogs** sector, focusing on primary data streams:

*   `AuthenticationEvents`: Records of personnel accessing the ship's systems.
*   `FileCreationEvents`: Intercepting signals of new files generated across the network.
*   `Employees`: The central crew manifest.

We may also intercept signals from `InboundBrowsing` and `OutboundBrowsing` for advanced tactical training.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before we ignite the engines, you must establish a secure uplink to the training simulation.

### 🚀 Uplink Procedure:

1.  Open your comms channel to: [aka.ms/adx](https://aka.ms/adx)
2.  Authenticate with your **Microsoft ID**.
3.  In the navigation panel, select **"Add Connection"**.
4.  Enter the training cluster coordinates: `help.kusto.windows.net`
5.  Lock on to the `SecurityLogs` database.

> **Warning:** The `help` cluster is a public frequency. Do not transmit classified data over this channel. Stick to the simulation parameters.

**Status:** Systems Online.
**Next Objective:** Verify Uplink.
