Welcome to the **KQL Pilot Academy**, Cadet.

This isn’t a typical course. It’s a flight simulator for **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** — with rewards, streaks, and a real-world uplink into **Azure Data Explorer (ADX)**. You are here to master the art of navigating massive telemetry streams within the **Kusto Nebula**.

## Kusto Propulsion

**Kusto** is the high-performance query engine behind **Azure Data Explorer** and also powers experiences like **Log Analytics**. It is the primary propulsion system for analyzing:

- **Security Events:** Intercepting unauthorized access attempts.
- **Authentication Telemetry:** Monitoring the crew's identity signals.
- **Operational Logs:** Keeping the ship's systems running at peak efficiency.

KQL is the language you’ll use to navigate these data streams.

## Operational Loop

Throughout your training, you will follow a standard operational loop:

1.  **Briefing:** Review the tactical concept.
2.  **Simulation:** Run the example in the **Holodeck** (safe local simulation).
3.  **Uplink:** Optionally use the **UPLINK** protocol to execute the same query in the real-world ADX environment.
4.  **Reward:** Earn **Stardust** and build your daily streak.

## Console Calibration

Run the simulation below to confirm your **Tactical Holodeck** is online and responsive.
