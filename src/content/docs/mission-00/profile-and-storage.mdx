Your pilot profile and progress data are stored locally within your vessel's (browser's) memory banks.

## Pilot Credentials

You can update your callsign and other identity details via the **Settings** console located in the top navigation bar.

## Data Storage

Your progress is stored entirely within your browser's local memory. 

### No Cross-Device Sync

-   **Isolation:** Your progress will not automatically sync between different devices or browsers.
-   **Data Persistence:** Clearing your browser's cache or site data will reset your local pilot profile.

### Privacy & Processing

-   **Local Processing:** All profile data remains on your machine. We do not process, store, or transmit your personal identity or progress data to external servers.
-   **Anonymity:** No account creation is required, ensuring your training remains private to your local station.

## Instant Ignition

-   **Instant Ignition:** No account creation or login required to start your training.
-   **Zero Latency:** Your profile loads instantly from local memory.
-   **Offline Capability:** Basic progress tracking works even when your uplink is intermittent.
