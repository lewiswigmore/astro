import Holodeck from '../../../components/Holodeck';

The **ADX `help` cluster** is a public training environment maintained by Microsoft. It serves as our primary target for real-world data exploration.

In this academy, the **Uplink** protocol points you to:

-   **Cluster:** `help` (Public Frequency)
-   **Database:** `SecurityLogs`

## Safe Harbor

-   **Safe Harbor:** It’s a sandbox environment designed for learning.
-   **Realistic Telemetry:** It contains sample tables that mirror real-world scenarios.
-   **Full Fidelity:** It behaves exactly like a production Kusto environment, including performance characteristics and query semantics.

## Target Coordinates

You will frequently intercept signals from these primary tables:

-   `AuthenticationEvents`: Records of personnel login attempts.
-   `Email`: Communication logs across the network.
-   `Employees`: The central crew manifest.
-   `FileCreationEvents`: Records of new files generated on systems.
-   `OutboundBrowsing`: Logs of external web traffic.
-   `PassiveDns`: DNS resolution history.
-   `ProcessEvents`: Execution logs of system processes.
-   `InboundBrowsing`: Logs of incoming web traffic.

## Flight Rules

-   **Public Frequency:** Treat the `help` cluster as a public space. Never transmit classified data or secrets.
-   **Efficiency:** Prefer using **time filters** and the `take` operator when exploring new sectors to avoid overloading your sensors.

## Fuel Management

Executing queries in the **Holodeck** or via the **Uplink** consumes your vessel's fuel.

-   **Passive Regeneration:** Your fuel cells automatically recharge at a rate of **1% per minute**.
-   **Fuel Breaks:** If you run low, you can initiate a **Fuel Break** (available every 30 minutes) to instantly restore a significant portion of your reserves.

## Tactical Exercise

Execute this simple "peek" query in the Holodeck, then use the **Uplink** to see it in the live ADX environment:

<Holodeck
  client:load
  runFuelCost={5}
  initialCode={`// Quick peek into the training data
ProcessEvents
| take 50
`}
/>

**Status:** Uplink Verified.
**Next Objective:** Station Tour.
