Welcome back, Pilot. Now that you've mastered the fundamentals of KQL, it's time to push your sensors to the limit.

In this mission, we will dive deep into:

1.  **Scanning Frequencies:** Learning the nuances of text search with `contains` and `has`.
2.  **Temporal Navigation:** Mastering time filters and absolute time references.
3.  **Time Warps & Aggregation:** Using `summarize` to turn raw stardust into meaningful constellations.

Prepare your systems. The data stream is about to get much more complex.
