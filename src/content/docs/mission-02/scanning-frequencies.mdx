When searching through logs, the way you scan for text can significantly impact your ship's performance.

### Scanning Frequencies (`contains` vs. `has`)

*   `contains`: A slow, deep scan. Searches for a substring anywhere.
*   `has`: A fast, indexed scan. Searches for whole words (tokens).

<Holodeck initialCode={`// This works because "fail" is a substring of "Failed"
AuthenticationEvents
| where result contains "fail"
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

<Holodeck initialCode={`// This query won't return results - 'has' requires exact word matches
AuthenticationEvents
| where result has "fail"
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

> **Why the `has` query failed:** The `has` operator looks for complete words. "Failed" is a word. "fail" is not.
