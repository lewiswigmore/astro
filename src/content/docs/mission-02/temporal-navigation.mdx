In the Kusto Nebula, time is the most important dimension. Almost every data stream is indexed by a timestamp.

### 1. The Golden Rule of KQL

**PILOT TIP:** Always filter by time first. The Kusto engine is optimized for temporal navigation. Filtering by time early reduces the "gravitational drag" on your query, making it run significantly faster.

### 2. The Historical Archive

**CRITICAL INTEL:** The telemetry logs in the `help` cluster are a historical archive from **early 2022**. 

Additionally, in this specific dataset, the `timestamp` field is stored as a **string**. To perform temporal maneuvers, you must first convert it to a **datetime** type using the `todatetime()` function.

### 3. Absolute Time (`datetime`)

To jump to a specific point in history, use the `datetime()` function. Note how we use `extend` to re-cast the timestamp before filtering.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Scan for events on a specific date in the archive
AuthenticationEvents
| extend timestamp = todatetime(timestamp)
| where timestamp >= datetime(2022-01-01) and timestamp <= datetime(2022-01-07)
| take 10`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 4. Time Ranges (`between`)

The `between` operator is the most elegant way to specify a start and end point in the historical logs.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// A more elegant way to scan a specific window in 2022
AuthenticationEvents
| extend timestamp = todatetime(timestamp)
| where timestamp between (datetime(2022-01-01) .. datetime(2022-01-07))
| count`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 5. Future Comms (`ago`)

In a live production environment (like a real ship's bridge), you will use the `ago()` function constantly to look back from the current moment.

*   `ago(1h)`: Last hour
*   `ago(7d)`: Last 7 days

> **Note:** While `ago()` is essential for real-time monitoring, it remains offline for this specific historical training exercise.
