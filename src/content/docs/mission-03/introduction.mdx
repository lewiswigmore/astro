You have reached the edge of known space, Commander. The queries ahead require precision and a deep understanding of how data relates across different systems.

In this final mission, we will cover:

1.  **Docking Procedures:** Combining data from multiple tables using `join`.
2.  **Advanced Joins:** Optimizing your docking procedures for maximum efficiency.
3.  **Deep Space Tactics:** Using variables and in-memory tables to build complex logic.
4.  **Deep Space Challenges:** Putting everything you've learned to the test in real-world scenarios.

The galaxy depends on your analysis. Good luck.
