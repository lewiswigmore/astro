import Holodeck from '../../../components/Holodeck';

Sometimes the data you need is scattered across different ships. To get the full picture, you must initiate a docking procedure (Join).

### 1. The Docking Maneuver (`join`)

The `join` operator merges two data streams based on a shared signal (key).

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Find IT associate employees with failed logins
AuthenticationEvents
| where result == "Failed Login"
| join kind=inner (
    Employees
    | where role == "IT associate"
) on username
| project timestamp, employee_name = name`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />

### 2. Docking Configurations (Join Kinds)

*   **`inner`**: Hard Dock. Only returns data if a match is found on both ships.
*   **`leftouter`**: Soft Dock. Keeps all data from your ship (left), and attaches data from the other ship (right) if available.
*   **`anti`**: Repel. Returns data from your ship that *does not* match the other ship.

<Holodeck initialCode={`// Example: Find users with failed logins and their employee details
// Using leftouter to include all failed logins, even for non-employees
AuthenticationEvents
| where result == "Failed Login"
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by username
| join kind=leftouter (Employees) on username
| project username, name, role, FailedAttempts
| top 10 by FailedAttempts desc`} runFuelCost={5} client:load />
